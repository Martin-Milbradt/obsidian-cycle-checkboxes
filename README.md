# Obsidian Cycle Checkboxes Plugin

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It has more functionality than the basic functions `Toggle checkbox status` and `Cycle bullet/checkbox`. It allows you to define a custom list of checkboxes to be cycled and also to cycle backwards.

## How to use

- Clone this repo.
- Make sure your NodeJS is at least v16 (`node --version`).
- `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies.
- `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.

## Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-cycle-checkboxes/`.
